WebSocket Wamp Cra Server
---------------------

When you don't have a Wamp Cra server around, you can use the
[WAMP CRA example](http://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/wamp/authentication) provided with AutobahnPython.


	cd scm/AutobahnPython/examples/wamp/authentication/
	python server.py


Running
-------

 1. Build and run the app.
 2. Enter the IP and port of your WAMP-CRA server.
 3. Press "connect".

For convenience, the app will remember the server IP/port as app settings.
