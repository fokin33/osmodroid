AutobahnTestsuite Client
========================

This example implements a client for the [AutobahnTestsuite](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite) so that
AutobahnAndroid can be tested for protocol compliance.


Running
-------

 1. Build and run the app.
 2. Enter the IP and port of your AutobahnTestsuite fuzzing server.
 3. Optionally, edit the client identification
 4. Press "Start Tests".
