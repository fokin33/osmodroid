AutobahnAndroid
===============

AutobahnAndroid implements **[The WebSocket Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)** and **[The WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)](http://wamp.ws/)**:

* library for WebSocket and WAMP clients
* implements WebSocket RFC6455, Draft Hybi-10+ and WAMP v1
* works on Android 2.2+
* very good standards conformance
* high-performance asynchronous design
* easy to use API
* seamless integration in Android UI apps
* no (really none) network activity on UI thread
* Open-source (Apache 2 license)

You can use AutobahnAndroid to create native Android apps talking to WebSocket servers or any WAMP compatible server.

Using WAMP you can build applications around **asynchronous RPC and PubSub** messaging patterns.
